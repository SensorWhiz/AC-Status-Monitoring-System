# AC-Status-Monitoring-System
This proposal advocates using sensors to detect the electromagnetic field from an air conditioner's compressor, signaling its operational status. This data is then transmitted to a microcontroller, which subsequently relays it to a mobile app via a communication module.
This study aids the electricity controlling unit of an establishment in identifying the exact locations and operational status of air conditioners in real-time. This information facilitates power usage analysis and potentially allows for power consumption reduction by selectively switching off power supply to specific AC units.
The system employs the WCS1700 Hall Effect current sensor, which is specifically designed to detect electromagnetic field variations generated by the current flowing through the air conditionerâ€™s compressor. 
An Arduino microcontroller is used to process the data collected by the WCS1700 sensor. 
Using Nodemcu the staus is wirelessly transmitted to mobile apps.
